This is a Chrome extension that allows you to quickly generate question/answer pairs via GPT-3 and add them to your Anki deck while browsing the web.

To use it:

Before installing extension:
1. Install and configure [anki-connect plugin](https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect/) for your desktop Anki client (ankiweb does not provide API access so this is necessary to programmatically insert cards).
3. Add ankiconnect API key [ankiconnect](/ankiconnect.png)
  1. Go to Add Ons Page in Anki (Shift + Cmd + A)
  2. Click on AnkiConnect (Get Add-Ons -> 2055492159 if it's not there already)
  3. It will pop up a JSON that you can edit.  Insert your secret key (something you make up), and then use that same key you made up in the chrome extension. The reason for setting this is because the extension will be talking to your Anki instance, and if we don't set a key than any random website that decides to call localhost at that port will be able to interact with your deck which you don't want.
3. Obtain an OpenAI API Key if you do not already have one

Installing extension:
1. npm install
2. npm run dev (you can cancel after the build folder is generated)
3. go to chrome://extensions, click "load unpacked" button and use the build folder from this repo as the directory to use.
4. Set the OpenAI key, anki-connect API key, and name of your anki deck in the options page of the Chrome extension (right click on options picture, or see the "Settings" button when you bring it up by selecting text - click on the messages to fill them in)

There was a problem with the production webpack build that I couldn't resolve, so I am just using the dev version for now. I will aim to fix it at some point

Happy prompt making!
